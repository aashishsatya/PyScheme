PyScheme:
---------

NOTE: PROJECT IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. MIGHT NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED.

In this project I try to implement a subset of the Scheme Programming Language in Python. This is a recommended excercise in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelson et. al. The question originally asked for an implementation in C, but I like Python a lot, so I went with it. 

Actually speaking, a Python implementation of Lisp has already been published by the computer science extraordinaire, Peter Norvig. His articles (namely "(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))" and "(An ((Even Better) Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))") have been great references.

I'm also planning to use this project to brush up my Git skills, so you'll find a lot of unnecessary branches here and there. Thank you!!
